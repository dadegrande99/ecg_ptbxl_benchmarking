- [X] [base_model](base_model.py)
  - it's empty
- [X] [basic_conv1d](basic_conv1d.py)
  - ok
  - It should be the first model to modify
- [ ] [fastai_model](fastai_model.py)
  - is the skeletron for every models
- [X] [inception1d](inception1d.py)
  - ok
- [X] [resnet1d](resnet1d.py)
  - it use only functions from `basic_conv1d`
- [X] [rnn1d](rnn1d.py)
  - ok
- [X] [timeseries_utils](timeseries_utils.py)
  - This is not a model
- [X] [wavelet](wavelet.py)
